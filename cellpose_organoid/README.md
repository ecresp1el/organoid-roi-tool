# Cellpose Organoid Pipeline

This folder contains helper scripts that turn the projections generated by
`simple_projection_tool/prepare_for_cellprofiler_cellpose.py` into training data
for Cellpose, produce quick segmentations, and manage the training workspace.
Everything here is written for the “whole organoid = one ROI” use case.

The scripts are designed so scientists can keep the heavy outputs (symlinks,
Cellpose logs, trained models) **outside of the git repository** but still reuse
the shared logic that lives in this folder.

---

## Prerequisites

1. Run the imaging pipeline through the `simple_projection_tool` stage:
   - `simple_channel_projections.py`
   - `run_projection_analysis.py`
   - `prepare_for_cellprofiler_cellpose.py`
2. Confirm the project drive now contains:
   ```
   <project>/cellprofilerandcellpose_folder/
     ├── cellprofilerandcellpose_metadata.csv
     └── cellpose_multichannel_zcyx/
         ├── <analysis>/<projection>/<group>/*.tif
         └── cellpose_multichannel_metadata.csv
   ```
3. Activate the Conda environment that has Cellpose installed
   (e.g. `conda activate cellprofiler_env`).

## Key Scripts

| Script | Purpose |
| ------ | ------- |
| `scripts/prepare_training_from_metadata.py` | Reads the metadata CSV and symlinks the selected TIFFs into a training folder. |
| `scripts/make_seg_from_model.py` | Runs a Cellpose model on one or more folders, generating the standard `*_seg.npy` files. |
| `train_organoid_model.sh` | End-to-end pipeline: link training data, generate labels (if missing), train a custom model, and archive the results. |
| `analyse_whole_organoid.py` | Summarise manually curated `_seg.npy` masks (WT vs KO tables/plots) using the multi-channel TIFF stacks. |

---

## Typical Training Workflow

1. **Edit `train_organoid_model.sh`**  
   Update these variables so they match your project drive:
   - `PROJECT_ROOT` – path to `cellprofilerandcellpose_folder`
   - `ANALYSIS`, `PROJECTION_TYPES`, `EXPERIMENT_GROUPS`, optional `CHANNEL_SLUGS`

2. **Run the training script**
   ```bash
   conda activate cellprofiler_env
   bash cellpose_organoid/train_organoid_model.sh
   ```
   The script creates a separate workspace next to the project data:
   ```
   <project>/cellpose_organoid_workspace/
     ├── data/train/          # symlinks to TIFFs from the metadata
     ├── logs/                # training logs (tee output)
     └── models/              # archived checkpoints
   ```

3. **Use the trained model**
   - Point `make_seg_from_model.py` at any directories that contain TIFFs.
   - Pass `--model` with either a Cellpose preset (e.g. `cyto3`) or a custom
     model folder exported by the training script.

### Manual mask creation (Cellpose GUI)

If you prefer to draw or verify masks manually, launch the Cellpose GUI from the
same `cellprofiler_env` environment:

```bash
conda activate cellprofiler_env
cellpose
```

Open the `WT` and `KO` folders under  
`<project>/cellpose_multichannel_zcyx/<analysis>/<projection>/`, set the diameter
to **1500**, `flow_threshold` to **0.1**, and `cellprob_threshold` to **-0.6`,
then save the results. The GUI writes the standard
`*_seg.npy`, `*_cp_masks.png`, and flow files next to each image in place. When
these exist, the automation in Step 2 recognises them and skips re-generating
labels, so the manual masks take precedence.

### Analyse manual whole-organoid masks

Once the GUI has saved `_seg.npy` files, recreate the WT vs KO summary tables
and plots with:

```bash
conda activate organoid_roi_incucyte_imaging
python cellpose_organoid/analyse_whole_organoid.py \
  --base-path /Volumes/Manny4TBUM/10_16_2025/lhx6_pdch19_WTvsKO_projectfolder \
  --analysis PCDHvsLHX6_WTvsKO_IHC \
  --projection max
```

Outputs are stored in
`<base>/analysis_results/<analysis>/whole_organoid_analysis/analysis_pipeline/`
with the same per-channel CSVs and summary figures used elsewhere in the
project, plus per-group masked-intensity panels (WT and KO) so you can visually
inspect the pixels each mask captures.

---

## Running Just the Helpers

Link training data manually (great for smoke tests):
```bash
python cellpose_organoid/scripts/prepare_training_from_metadata.py \
  --metadata /path/to/cellpose_multichannel_metadata.csv \
  --output /path/to/workspace/data/train \
  --analysis PCDHvsLHX6_WTvsKO_IHC \
  --projection max \
  --group WT --group KO
```

Generate segmentations for a folder:
```bash
python cellpose_organoid/scripts/make_seg_from_model.py \
  --dirs /path/to/workspace/data/train \
  --model cyto3 \
  --diameter 1500
```

Both commands print detailed progress and timings so you can track what the
pipeline is doing.

## Housekeeping

- The workspace folder can be deleted and recreated safely; the scripts only
  create symlinks and new outputs.
- Training logs are timestamped, so you can keep multiple runs if desired.
- The git repository stays clean because no training artifacts are written
  under `cellpose_organoid/`.
